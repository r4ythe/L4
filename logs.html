Hi, I'm Lull4by, you can just call me Ray.<br>
I'm learning about coding (English, too) and this is my first output. I'll keep change this homepage's style whenever I need or want. I stream on Twitch sometimes. You can visit the channel from <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lull4by__/" target="_blank">here</a> if you want :) I wish you all the best.

We don't know whom we are gonna encounter today.<br>
Sometimes it turns out sad because you can meet someone just had a bad thing and lost constrol of oneself. Of course usually we can handle that situation... but sadly there's times we are defenceless even it's just a moment. If then we unconsciously absorb all feelings they emit and we should try hard to deal with those negative things.

<h3>11/18/2019</h3>
Sometimes it's really hard to keep my mind straight. But If I have things do regularly, it's really helping with sanity. Whethere it's a work, exercise, diary, cooking, no matter what it is as long as it's productive.
